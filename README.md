# Track Buddy 🏁

A comprehensive weather tracking and weekend organization application designed specifically for racing teams, drivers, and motorsport enthusiasts. Get real-time weather data, track conditions, and manage racing notes, iteneraries and setups for tracks worldwide.

Please see below the state of our current publishing.

🤖 Android - APK Directly from releases ( Coming Soon)

📱 iOS - At Present we are not publishing to the AppStore. The process is not cheap or straightforward. At some point we will bring this application to iOS but at this moment it is not in the cards.

💻 Web - You can access the project on the web here ( Coming Soon ). Your Browser storage is used so your sessions can persist even in new browser windows/tabs.

# About the Creator

This app was created by Racing Driver and Professional Sim Racer Daniel Oliver. Daniel noticed that there was a gap - no centralized place to have ALL of what you need on a track weekend. Whether HPDE, Time Attack or Professional Racing. Because of this - Daniel leveraged his long time engineering background to create this completely free application. This application is iterative and is intended to be free for as long as possible. If at some point demand for things like iOS or other services that would be best supported by a paid version - that will be explored. But for now, please enjoy.
